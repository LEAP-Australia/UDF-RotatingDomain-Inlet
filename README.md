Purpose
=======

Profile for inlet velocity for use in rotating domain SFR models.

Prerequisites
=============

1.  The normal of the inlet boundary face is parallel to the tangent of
    the rotating path.
2.  Scheme variable described in inletSetup.scm are defined corectely
    and consistentely to the domain of rotation.
